                                <p>Darren Walker is president of the Ford Foundation, where he oversees more than $12 billion in assets, $500 million annually in global social justice grants and 10 international offices. A leader in the social sector for more than two decades, including serving as Vice President at the Rockefeller Foundation, his expertise ranges from human rights to urban development to free expression. He spent almost a decade on the frontlines of community development at Harlem’s Abyssinian Development Corporation, after a career working in international finance and law at UBS and Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton. Walker voices a unique perspective on the ways that market forces, democratic institutions, and an independent non-profit sector must work together to achieve lasting social change.</p>
